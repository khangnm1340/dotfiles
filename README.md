# Pam's Dotfiles ðŸ¦¦

A collection of my personal configuration files for various applications. These are the settings I use for my Arch Linux Enviroment

## About This Repository

These dotfiles customize my development and desktop environment, which includes configurations for:

-   **Window Manager:** [Hyprland](https://wiki.hypr.land/)
-   **Terminals:**  [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
-   **Shells:** Bash, [Fish](https://fishshell.com/), [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) with [starship](https://starship.rs/)
-   **Editors:** Neovim, [Zed](https://zed.dev/), [Neovide](https://neovide.dev/)
-   **Status Bar:** [Waybar](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Waybar)
-   And many other tools.

The configurations are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which creates symlinks from this repository to the correct locations in the home directory.

## Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

-   You must have [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) installed.

### 2. Setup Instructions

1.  **Navigate to your home directory**:
    ```bash
    cd ~

2.  **Clone the repository into your home directory** :

3.  **Run Stow to create the symlinks**:
    The command will link the configuration files from the `pamsdots` directory to your home directory.
